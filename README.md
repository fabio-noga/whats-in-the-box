### Our purpose 💪

Around 2020/2021, we were asked to do a free-theme project in Unity for the Computer Graphics course during our master's degree at the University of Porto.

We wanted to go further and decided to program an augmented reality mobile app. We got the highest grade and we're happy about that. Here is our work accessible to everyone.
